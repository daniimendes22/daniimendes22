I am a Software Developer passionate about planning and implementing modern and secure websites.
I am ready for challenges with different requirements, as it is always important for me not to resort to standard solutions, but to develop an appropriate concept.
I have experience with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJs, NextJS and I am focused on building products with high-performance, scalability and security features. If you have a challenge for me: letâ€™s talk!
